By the end of the week all developers can:


1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

# Evidence


1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods

... Will be in the Boris_Bikes repo (will link at the end of the week)
