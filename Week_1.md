## Week 1

# Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:


1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

# Evidence


1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
... [TDD shown here](https://github.com/RaeRachael/little_random_things/tree/master/TDD_playground)
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
... Will be in the Boris_Bikes repo (will link at the end of the week)
3. Follow an effective debugging process
... find commit message that fixed ruby game.rb while irb - r 'game' for fine. [relevant commit message1](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game/commit/6a23fedbc4ef37321d61e54a1fed3adea94234f9) [relavant commit message 2](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game/tree/master/spec)
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
... [explore_game readme.md](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game/blob/master/readme.md), the visualation of the code shows some of this concepts being used and a visual understanding of what they are.

goal: setup and have a success pairing session. </break>
evidence: repro made at end of the day - [repro](https://github.com/RaeRachael/Boris_Bikes)


## Wednesday 13th May
goal: a good pairing session, setting out to take breaks at a sensible time, making sure both people are clear with each stage. </break>
proof: conversation at the end of the session, and also the work created by it. </break>
evidence: [repro] (https://github.com/RaeRachael/Boris_Bikes)

bonus goal: work on the readme.md file for exploration game based on feedback from the coach. </break>
proof: commit messages </break>
evidence: [readme.md](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game/blob/master/readme.md)

## Thursday 14th May
goal: try to be less dictator-y when navigating, my goal is to remind the driver of the target result of the method rather than specify how it is done. </break>
proof: conversation at the end of the session, and also the work created by it. </break>
evidence: [repro](https://github.com/RaeRachael/boris_bikes-1)

bonus goal: finish work on the readme.md file, screenshot and visual representation of the current code state </break>
proof: commit messages
evidence: [readme.md](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game/blob/master/readme.md)

## Friday 15th May
goal: improve ability to write tests in Rspec, and to check [relishapp](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers) for suitable matchers if and when needed. </break>
proof: set sensible test for the made methods in explore_game, then if time set up tests for a user menu in the game.rb file </break>
evidence: [spec files](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game/tree/master/spec)
